This repo contains inputs, outputs, analyses, and write-up for a draft of the second aim of my dissertation. 

In this aim, I test the following three hypotheses: 
1.	County-to-county migration flows improve the explainability of autoregressive models of county-level health outcomes. 
2.	The role that county-to-county migration flows plays in county-level health outcomes differs significantly between rural and urban counties.
3.	Considering unmeasured factors in county-to-county migration flows improves our ability to explain county-level health outcomes as well as the differential role that migration plays in urban versus rural counties.

This aim uses publicly accessible data from the IRS and CDC WONDER. 

The simulation part of this aim requires UW Madison's CHTC system. Here's the help page for CHTC (for my future reference)
