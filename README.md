This repo contains inputs, outputs, analyses, and write-up for a draft of the second aim of my dissertation. 

In this aim, I test the following three hypotheses: 
1.	County-to-county migration flows improve the explainability of autoregressive models of county-level health outcomes. 
2.	The role that county-to-county migration flows plays in county-level health outcomes differs significantly between rural and urban counties.
3.	Considering unmeasured factors in county-to-county migration flows improves our ability to explain county-level health outcomes as well as the differential role that migration plays in urban versus rural counties.

This aim uses publicly accessible data from the IRS and CDC WONDER.
